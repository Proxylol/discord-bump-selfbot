<p align="center">Simple self-bot for discord that automatically bumps your server. (Disboard)</p>



<h3>Requirements</h3>

- Discord-S.C.U.M
```
python -m pip install --user --upgrade git+https://github.com/Merubokkusu/Discord-S.C.U.M.git#egg=discum
```
<h3>How it works</h3>

It's simple! Every 5-6 minutes (or whatever you set it to), the bot will send the bump command. Disboard only allows you to bump every 2 hours, so this is a way to continuously keep checking without being rate-limited by discord and disboard. Please note that you can edit the time frame.
